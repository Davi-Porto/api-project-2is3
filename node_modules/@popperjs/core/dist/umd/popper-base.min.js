Description: powerful markdown processor in Go geared towards the IETF (program)
 Mmark is a powerful markdown processor written in Go, geared towards
 writing IETF documents. It is, however, *also* suited for writing
 complete books and other technical documentation, like the Learning Go
 book (https://miek.nl/go), Internet-Draft text output
 (https://miek.nl/go/learninggo-2.txt)) and RFCs.
 .
 It provides an advanced markdown dialect that processes file(s) to
 produce internet-drafts in XML RFC 7991 format. Mmark can produce
 xml2rfc (aforementioned RFC 7991), HTML5 output, and manual pages.
 .
 Mmark uses gomarkdown (https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) which is
 a fork of blackfriday (https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/).
 .
 This package provides the /usr/bin/mmark executable binary and documentation.

Description: create a Debian chroot
 Downloads, unpacks and installs Debian packages to either directly create a
 directory which can be chrooted into, or a tarball of it. In contrast to
 debootstrap it uses apt, supports more than one mirror, automatically uses
 security and updates mirrors for Debian stable chroots, is 3-6 times faster,
 produces smaller output by removing unnecessary cruft, is bit-by-bit
 reproducible if $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set, allows unprivileged operation using
 Linux user namespaces, fakechroot or proot and can setup foreign architecture
 chroots using qemu-user.

Description: set of electronic mail handling programs
 This is the mmh mail user agent (reader/sender), a command-line based mail
 reader that is powerful and extensible.  mmh is an excellent choice for
 people who receive and process a lot of mail.
 .
 Unlike most mail user agents, mmh is not a single program, rather it is a
 set of programs that are run from the shell.  This allows the user to
 utilize the full power of the Unix shell in coordination with mmh.
 .
 Mmh is a modified version of the electronic mail handling system nmh.
 Nmh (new MH) itself was originally based on the package MH-6.8.3, and
 was intended to be a (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.
 In contrast, mmh is not intended to be a drop-in replacement for nmh,
 rather mmh breaks compatibility to nmh in order to modernize and
 simplify it.

Description: library for handling Music Macro Language (tools)
 MMLlib is a pure Python implementation of functionality related to the
 Music Macro Language as implemented by Microsoft® GW-BASIC® and
 compatibles, which is its most common form, also implemented by the PC
 speaker driver in Linux and BSD, with a number of extensions and
 changes.
 .
 This package contains command-line tools for handling MML. These
 currently are:
 .
  mml2musicxml - convert MML to MusicXML (cf. musescore)
  mmllint - check various aspects of MML files for correctness
